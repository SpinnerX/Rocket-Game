# Small-Game-Engine
* Small rocket game that utilizes basic flappy bird mechancis for testing my Game Engine, \
I am in progress of building. 
* In the engines current state at the creation of this game, the engine does not have physics \
  simulator, particle systems, and post processing.
* Had to implement a much quick and easy route for those implementations.
* Below is a quick short video that showcases the basic particle system, basic physics, and a very \
  minimal UI interaction with the user integrated into the game.
