# Small-Game-Engine
* Small rocket game that utilizes basic flappy bird and the rockets in geometry dash mechanics for testing my Game Engine, \
* In the engine's current state at the time of creating this game, the engine does not have physics \
  simulator, particle systems, and post-processing.
* Had to implement a much quicker and easier route for those implementations.
* Below is a quick short video that showcases the basic particle system, basic physics, and a very \
  minimal UI interaction with the user integrated into the game.
